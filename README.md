```
git clone https://github.com/soumikroyfreelancer1/aws_first_app.git
```

2. Setup the following environment variables - `(.env)` file

```
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
API_KEY=your-secret-key-here
GREETING=Hello from Environment Variables!
```

> For this project, we'll have to set up an [Elastic IP Address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) for our EC2 & that would be our `DOMAIN`

3. Initialise and start the project

```
npm install
npm run start
```

> NOTE - We will have to edit the **inbound rules** in the security group of our EC2, in order to allow traffic from our particular port
